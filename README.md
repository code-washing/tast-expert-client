# Project Task Expert

Live link: https://task-expert.web.app/

This is a simplistic drag and drop task management web app that anybody can use for their daily life task management. It has three stages of task management - todo, ongoing, completed. Dragging and dropping updates UI along with the database itself. It is completely responsive. I used HTML drag and drop API for the drag and drop functionality. Currently it doesn't offer drag and drop support for touchscreens but I'm working on it and will add the functionality soon.
